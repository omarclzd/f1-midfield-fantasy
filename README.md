# F1 Midfield Fantasy

F1 Midfield Fantasy is an application that allows the user to create a team of five drivers from the twenty that compete in the Formula One Championship. The user will be able to manage the team by adding or removing drivers. The application will update after every grand prix and show the results of the race. Each race, the drivers will accumulate points based on their grid positions. However, in order for the user’s team to accumulate points, the selected drivers must finish in positions 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, or 8th. If a user’s driver does not finish in one of the previously mentioned positions, he will not accumulate any points.
